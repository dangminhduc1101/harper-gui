# harper_gui_winforms_protopye
## Description
A prototype of the WinForms C#-based graphical user interface that controls the humanoid robot HARPER in Vassar College's Robotics Lab. The prototype helps easily control one or multiple servos at the same time. 
## Notes
This prototype only works in limited functionality with VS debug mode, with the gesture creators and perception modules being disabled. The prototype was coded without scalability in mind, therefore the codebase is neither well-structured nor well-documented. Currently, the prototype will receive no more adjustment, and future improvements, developments and release of the application will be worked on in the MVC branch.
