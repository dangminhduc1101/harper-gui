# harper_gui
## Description
A C#-based graphical user interface for the humanoid robot HARPER in Vassar College's Robotics Lab. The application helps with controlling one or multiple robot servos at the same time. 
## Notes
This application only works in limited functionality with VS debug mode, with the gesture creators and perception modules being disabled. The application was coded for quick iterative testing and without scalability in mind, therefore the codebase is neither well-structured nor well-documented.
1. Visual Studio with .NET Framework 4.8
2. Arduino microcontroller(s)
## Installation
1. Clone this repository
2. Open harper_gui.sln with Visual Studio
